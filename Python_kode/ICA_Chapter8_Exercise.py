having the same (zero) mean and variance. (Hint: you can here estimate the pdf
from the generated samples simply by dividing their value range into small bins
of width 0.1 or 0.05, count the number of samples falling into each bin, and 
divide by the total number of samples. You can compute the difference between 
the respective gaussian and the estimated density to get a better idea of the 
similarity of the two distributions.)
