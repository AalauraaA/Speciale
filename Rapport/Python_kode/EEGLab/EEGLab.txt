Channel Locations
- Information about the scalp locations of the recording electrodes
- Electrodes plotted outside the head cartoon are electrodes located below the mid-head line (i.e., with a negative z (height) coordinate, 0 being the center of the head). 

Plotting Channel Spectra and Maps
- Plot of the channel spectra and associated topographical maps
- Only 15 % of the data with frequency between 2 and 25 Hz
- Each colored trace represents the spectrum of the activity of one data channel

Preprocessing
- Remove linear trends with high-pass filter (FIR) with a low egde frequency pass band at 1 Hz

Extract Epochs
- These data were constructed by concatenating three-second epochs from one subject, each containing a target square in the attended location ('square' events, left-hemifield locations 1 or 2 only) followed by a button response ('rt' events). The data were stored in continuous data format to illustrate the process of epoch extraction from continuous data.
- Removing a mean baseline value from each epoch. By default baseline removal will be performed on all channels data.
- The baseline latency range is [-1000 0] as in [min max] in ms, where [] is a whole epoch
