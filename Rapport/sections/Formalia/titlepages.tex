The thesis deals with the problem of recovering original brain source signals from low-density EEG measurements. 
Based on state of the art methods, an algorithm was proposed, for reproducing the current results.
The algorithm aim to leverage a covariance-domain dictionary learning (Cov-DL) method and a multiple sparse Bayesian learning (M-SBL) method. The proposed application of Cov-DL did not succeed. 
Thus, an alternative solution was proposed. 
The proposed algorithm was tested on EEG scalp measurements and compared to solutions obtained by ICA of high-density EEG measurements. 
Furthermore, a frequency analysis was performed comparing raw measurements and the recovered sources. 
From the perspective of practical use, an estimation of the unknown number of active source signals was proposed. 
It was concluded that the proposed algorithm did not reproduce the state of the art results. 
Though the M-SBL method alone was successful and a potential was seen for an estimation of the number of active sources, from M-SBL.
