  This thesis deals with the problem of recovering original brain source signals from low density EEG measurement. Based on state of the art methods an algorithm is proposed, for recreating the current results. 
The algorithm aim to leverage a covariance-domain dictionary learning (COV-DL) method and a multiple sparse Bayesian learning (M-SBL) method. The proposed application of COV-DL did not succeed. 
  Thus an alternative solution is proposed. 
  The proposed algorithm is tested on EEG measurement and compared to solutions obtained by ICA of non-low density EEG. Furthermore, a frequency analysis is performed comparing raw measurements and recovered sources. 
  From the perspective of practical use, an estimation of the unknown number of active source signals is proposed. 
  It is concluded that the proposed algorithm did not reproduce the state of the art conclusions. Though the M-SBL method alone was successful and a potential was see for an estimation of the number of active source, from M-SBL.
