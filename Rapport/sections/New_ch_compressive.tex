\chapter{System Model}\label{ch:system_model}
Through this chapter a model representing the EEG measurements is specified. Along with the model different terminologies is introduced and described for further use in this thesis. At last the solution approach for estimating the model variables(rather than parameters right?) is described, setting the outline of the remaining chapters of the thesis.
