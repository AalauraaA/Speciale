\chapter{Covariance-Domain Dictionary Learning}\label{ch:Cov-DL}
Through this chapter the method covariance-domain dictionary learning (Cov-DL) is presented in details. 
Along the presentation of the general method, necessary computational details are derived.
The purpose is to recover the mixing matrix $\mathbf{A}_s$ from the segmented MMV model, derived in chapter \ref{ch:system_model}. Especially for the under-determined case. 
In the context of compressive sensing, the mixing matrix $\mathbf{A}_s$ is referred to a the dictionary matrix. 
This corresponds to the mixing matrix being estimated as a dictionary matrix, through the process of dictionary learning. 
This will be elaborated further in the section concerning dictionary learning.

Cov-DL is a method proposed by O. Balkan \cite{Balkan2015}, leveraging the increased dimensionality of the covariance-domain. 
The method has shown successful recovery of the mixing matrix $\mathbf{A}_s$. Even in the non-sparse, under-determined case with more active sources $k$ than observed measurements $M$, $k \geq M$. 
In short the algorithm consists of three steps. 
First the EEG measurements are transformed onto the covariance-domain. 
Then, by the increased dimensionality of the covariance-domain, it is possible to learn the transformed mixing matrix of the covariance-domain. The transformed mixing matrix is denoted by $\mathbf{D}$, based on the theory of compressive sensing. 
Here two different cases will appear depending on the relation between the number of sources $N$ and the found dimension of the covariance-domain, the number of measurements $M$. 
Lastly, an inverse transformation is performed on the learned matrix $\mathbf{D}$, in order to obtain the wanted estimate of the mixing matrix $\mathbf{A}_s$. 
An essential aspect of this method is the prior assumption that the sources within one segment are uncorrelated, that is the rows of $\mathbf{X}_s$ being mutually uncorrelated. 

The section is inspired by the article \cite{Balkan2015} and chapter 3 in \cite{phd2015}. 
Selected general theory supporting essential parts of the method is elaborated in appendix \ref{app:Cov-DL}.
