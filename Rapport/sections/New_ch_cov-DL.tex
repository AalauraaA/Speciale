\chapter{Covariance-Domain Dictionary \\ Learning}\label{ch:Cov-DL}
Through this chapter the method covariance-domain dictionary learning to recover the mixing matrix $\mathbf{A}$ from the multiple measurement vector (MMV) model \eqref{eq:MMV_model} will be presented along with the necessary theory such as compressive sensing and dictionary learning.

Covariance-domain dictionary learning (Cov-DL) is an algorithm proposed by O. Balkan \cite{Balkan2015}, claiming to successfully identify more active sources $k$ than available measurements $M$, $k \geq M$, by transforming the segmented MMV model of the EEG measurements
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{Y}_s = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{X}_s + \textbf{E}_s,
\end{align*}
into the covariance domain and then bypass the limitation of compressive sensing as mentioned in section \ref{sec:sol_met}. 
To get a deeper understanding of the Cov-DL algorithm the theory of compressive sensing will be introduce in section \ref{sec:CS}. 
With the knowledge of compressive sensing Cov-DL will be further described regarding how the transformation of a compressive sensing related model overcomes the limitation of having less or equal activation of sources than sensors, $k \leq M$, as described in section \ref{sec:sol_met}. This will be done in section \ref{sec:cov}.
