\chapter{Covariance-Domain Dictionary \\ Learning}\label{ch:Cov-DL}
Through this chapter the method covariance-domain dictionary learning to recover the mixing matrix $\mathbf{A}$ from the multiple measurement vector (MMV) model \eqref{eq:MMV_model} will be presented along with the necessary theory such as compressive sensing and dictionary learning.

Covariance-domain dictionary learning (Cov-DL) is an algorithm proposed by O. Balkan \cite{Balkan2015}, claiming to successfully identify more active sources $k$ than available measurements $M$, $k \geq M$, by transforming the segmented MMV model of the EEG measurements
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{Y}_s = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{X}_s + \textbf{E}_s,
\end{align*}
into the covariance domain and then bypass the limitation of compressive sensing as mentioned in section \ref{sec:sol_met}. 
To get a deeper understanding of the Cov-DL algorithm the theory of compressive sensing will be introduce in section \ref{sec:CS}. 
With the knowledge of compressive sensing Cov-DL will be further described regarding how the transformation of a compressive sensing related model overcomes the limitation of having less or equal activation of sources than sensors, $k \leq M$, as described in section \ref{sec:sol_met}. This will be done in section \ref{sec:cov}.

The Cov-DL algorithm takes advantage of the covariance domain where the dimensionality is increased allowing for an enlarged number of sources to be active. 
An important aspect of this method is the prior assumption that the sources within one segment are uncorrelated, that is the rows of $\textbf{X}_s$ being mutually uncorrelated. 

The Cov-DL algorithm do only recover the mixing matrix $\mathbf{A}$ given the measurements $\textbf{Y}_s$. Given $\textbf{A}$ the non-segmented source matrix $\mathbf{X}$ is to be recovered by use of the Multiple Sparse Bayesian Learning algorithm, this is described in chapter \ref{ch:M-SBL} 
The section is inspired by chapter 3 in \cite{phd2015} and the article \cite{Balkan2015}.
