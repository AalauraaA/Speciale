\chapter{Covariance-Domain Dictionary Learning}\label{ch:Cov-DL}
Through this chapter a method to recover the mixing matrix $\mathbf{A}$ from the multiple measurement vector (MMV) model \eqref{eq:MMV_model} will be presented along with the necessary theory such as compressive sensing, dictionary learning and the dictionary learning method K-SVD. 

Covariance-domain dictionary learning (Cov-DL) is an algorithm proposed by O. Balkan \cite{Balkan2015}, claiming to successfully identify more active sources $k$ than available measurements $M$ by transforming the segmented multiple measurement vector model 
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{Y}_s = \mathbf{A}_s \mathbf{X}_s + \textbf{E}_s,
\end{align*}
into the covariance domain and the bypass the limitation of compressive sensing.



$\mathbf{Y}_s \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times t_s f}$ is the observed segmented EEG measurement matrix, $\mathbf{X}_s \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times t_s f}$ the segmented source matrix and $\mathbf{E}_s \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times t_s f}$ is the additional segmented noise matrix.
\\
Cov-DL takes advantage of the covariance domain where the dimensionality is increased allowing for an enlarged number of sources to be active while the dictionary remains recoverable.  
An important aspect of this method is the prior assumption that the sources within one segment are uncorrelated, that is the rows of $\textbf{X}_s$ being mutually uncorrelated. 
From the assumption of uncorrelated sources it can be assumed that the sample covariance of $\textbf{X}_s$ becomes nearly diagonal. 
This is of importance when the system is transformed to the covariance domain.    
\\
The Cov-DL do only recover the mixing matrix $\mathbf{A}$ given the measurements $\textbf{Y}$. Given $\textbf{A}$ the source matrix $\mathbf{X}$ is to be recovered by use of the Multiple Sparse Bayesian Learning algorithm, this is described in section \ref{ch:M-SBL}
