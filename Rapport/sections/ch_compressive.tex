\chapter{Sparse Signal Recovery}
Through this chapter an introduction to the concept compressive sensing is given with associated theory which later on will be used in the development of the algorithm with used methods known from compressive sensing to estimate the mixing matrix $\mathbf{A}$ and the sparse source matrix $\mathbf{X}$.
