\section{ICA}
Through this section the mathematical concepts of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) will be explained and defined.

Lets set up an situations. We have some measurements that has been affect by some surronding noise or "sidel√∏bende" mesurements such as different conversations in a room. The measurements can be described by a vector $\mathbf{y}$ if we look at the one-dimensional case. $\mathbf{y}$ consist of the measurement from the original signal, a vector $\mathbf{x}$ and surronding measurements, a matrix $\mathbf{A}$. This situation can be described as the linear model
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Ax} = \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{a}_i x_i
\end{align*}
We known the measurements $\mathbf{y}$ but if also knew the mixing parameter in $\mathbf{A}$ then by inverting the linear model we could solve the system and find the original signal. But this is not the case as the mixing matrix also is unknown.
\\
If we used the statistical properties of $\mathbf{x}$ then it would be possible to estimate both the mixing matrix and then the original signal. What ICA do is to assume statistical independence 
\\ \\
Lets define the ICA model which is a generative model meaning that the observed data is generated by a process of mixing components which are latent component. Let $n$ be the observed random variables such that $y_1, \dots, y_n$ are model as a linear combination of the random variables $x_1, \dots, x_n$:
\begin{align*}
y_i &= a_{i1} x_1 + a_{i2} x_2 + \cdots + a_{in} x_n, \quad i = 1, \dots, n \\
\mathbf{y} &= 
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \cdots & \vdots \\
a_{n1} & a_{n2} & \cdots & a_{nn}
\end{bmatrix}
\mathbf{x}
\end{align*}
where $\mathbf{y} = \{ y_i \}_{i \in [1,n]}$ and $\mathbf{x} = \{ x_t \}_{t \in [1,n]}$. Furthermore, $\mathbf{x}$ is statistically mutually independent.

Notes:
ICA can be used on gaussian variables as little is done in addition to decorrelate for gaussian variable

Whiting is useful to be done beore ICA
