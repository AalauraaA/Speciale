\section{Limitations of compressive sensing}
Through this chapter the concept of sparse signal recovery have been explained. The essential limitation of source recovery is that for $k>M$ it is not possible to recover $\textbf{x}$ as the system becomes underdetermined. Similarly we can not find the true dictionary $\textbf{A}$ by dictionary learning methods because when $k>M$, any random dictionary can be used to create $\textbf{y}$ from $\geq M$ basis vectors. \\
When considering source recovery from EEG measurements, described in section \ref{sec:EEG}, it is not reasonable to assume that $k<M$ especially not in the case of low density EEG measurements. This motives the next two chapters where the possibility of sources recovery for $k>M$ is explored. The methods, proposed recently by O. Balkan, are taking advantage of the covariance domain and..
