\section{Limitations of compressive sensing}
Through this chapter the concept of sparse signal recovery have been 

in general for $k>M$ it is not possible to recover $\textbf{x}$ as the system is underdetermined/overcomplete, furthermore we can not find the true dictionary $\textbf{A}$ by dictionary learning methods because when $k>M$, where $M$ is the dimension of $\textbf{y}$, any random dictionary can be used create $\textbf{y}$ from $\geq M$ basis vectors. that is generally the accuracy of recovery a $\textbf{A}$ increases as $k<<M$.\\
