\section{Covariances Domain Representation}\label{sec:cov}
Consider a single sample vector $\textbf{y}_i$, containing EEG measurements. 
The covariance of $\textbf{y}_i$ is to be defined by
\begin{align*}
\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{\textbf{x}_i}=\mathbb{E}[(\textbf{y}_i-\mathbb{E}[\textbf{y}_i])(\textbf{y}_i-\mathbb{E}[\textbf{y}_i])],
\end{align*}
where $\mathbb{E}[\cdot)]$ is the expected value operator. 
Assume that all samples vectors $\textbf{y}_i$ within one segment has zero mean and the same distribution. 
Then, the observed segmented EEG measurements matrix $\mathbf{Y}_s \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times L_s}$ is to be described in the covariance domain by the sample covariance $\widehat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}$ which is defined as the covariance among the $M$ measurements across the $L_s$ samples. That is a $M \times M$ matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{\mathbf{Y}_s}=[\sigma_{jk}]$ with entries 
\begin{align*}
\sigma_{jk}= \frac{1}{L_s}\sum_{i=1}^{L_s} y_{ji} y_{ki}.
\end{align*}
Using matrix notation the sample covariance of $\mathbf{Y}_s$ can be written as
\begin{align*}
\widehat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_{\mathbf{Y}_s} = \frac{1}{L_s} \mathbf{Y}_s \mathbf{Y}_s^T.
\end{align*}  
Similar the source matrix $\mathbf{X}_s$ can be described in the covariance domain by the sample covariance matrix.
\begin{align*}
\widehat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_{\mathbf{X}_s} &= \frac{1}{L_s} \mathbf{X}_s \mathbf{X}_s^T = \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_s + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} 
\end{align*}
From the assumption of uncorrelated sources within $\mathbf{X}_s$ the sample covariance matrix is expected to be nearly diagonal, thus it can be written as $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_s + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$ where $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_s$ is a diagonal matrix consisting of the diagonal entries of $\widehat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_{\mathbf{X}_s}$ and $ \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$ is the estimation error\cite{Balkan2015}.
Each segment is then modelled in the covariance domain as
\begin{align} 
\widehat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_{\mathbf{Y}_s} = \frac{1}{L_s}\mathbf{Y}_s \mathbf{Y}_s^T &= \frac{1}{L_s} \left( \mathbf{A} \mathbf{X}_s + \mathbf{E}_s \right) \left( \mathbf{A} \mathbf{X}_s + \mathbf{E}_s\right)^T \nonumber \\ 
\mathbf{Y}_s \mathbf{Y}_s^T &= (\textbf{AX}_s)(\textbf{AX}_s)^T + \textbf{E}_s \textbf{E}_s^T + \textbf{E}_s (\textbf{AX}_s)^T + \textbf{AX}_s \textbf{E}_s^T \nonumber \\
&= \textbf{AX}_s \textbf{X}_s^T \textbf{A}^T + \textbf{E}_s \textbf{E}_s^T + \textbf{E}_s \textbf{X}_s^T \textbf{A}^T + \textbf{AX}_s \textbf{E}_s^T \nonumber \\
&= \textbf{A}(\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_s +\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}) \textbf{A}^T + \textbf{E}_s \textbf{E}_s^T + \textbf{E}_s \textbf{X}_s^T \textbf{A}^T + \textbf{AX}_s \textbf{E}_s^T \nonumber \\
&= \textbf{A} \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_s \textbf{A}^T + \textbf{A} \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} \textbf{A}^T + \textbf{E}_s \textbf{E}_s^T + \textbf{E}_s \textbf{X}_s^T \textbf{A}^T + \textbf{AX}_s \textbf{E}_s^T \label{eq:noise1} \\
&= \textbf{A} \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_s \textbf{A}^T + \widetilde{\textbf{E}} \label{eq:noise2}
\end{align}
From \eqref{eq:noise1} to \eqref{eq:noise2} all terms where noise is included are defined as a united noise term $\widetilde{\textbf{E}}$. 
By vector notation \eqref{eq:noise2} is rewritten to be vectorized. 
Because the covariance matrix $\widehat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_{\mathbf{Y}_s}$ is symmetric it is sufficient to vectorize only the lower triangular parts, including the diagonal. 
For this the function $\text{vec}(\cdot)$ is defined to map a symmetric $M \times M$ matrix into a vector of size $\frac{M(M+1)}{2}$ making a row-wise vectorization of its upper triangular part. 
Furthermore, let vec$^{-1}(\cdot)$ be the inverse function for de-vectorisation. 
This results in the following model        
\begin{align}
\widehat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_{\mathbf{Y}_s} &= \sum_{i=1}^{N}  \textbf{a}_i \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_{s_{ii}} \textbf{a}_i^{T} + \widetilde{\textbf{E}} \nonumber \\
& \nonumber \\
\text{vec}(\widehat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_{\mathbf{Y}_s}) &= \sum_{i=1}^N \text{vec}(\mathbf{a}_i \mathbf{a}_i^T) \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_{s_{ii}} + \text{vec}( \widetilde{\textbf{E}}) \nonumber \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{d}_i \boldsymbol{\Lambda}_{s_{ii}} + \text{vec}( \widetilde{\textbf{E}}) \nonumber \nonumber \\
&= \mathbf{D} \boldsymbol{\delta}_s + \text{vec}( \widetilde{\textbf{E}}), \quad \forall s. \label{eq:cov1}
\end{align}
Here $\boldsymbol{\delta}_s \in \mathbb{R}^{N}$ contains the diagonal entries of the source sample-covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}_s$
and the matrix $\mathbf{D} \in \mathbb{R}^{(M(M+1))/2 \times N}$ consists of the columns $\mathbf{d}_i = \text{vec}(\mathbf{a}_i \mathbf{a}_i^T)$. Note that $\mathbf{D}$ and $\boldsymbol{\delta}_s$ are unknown while $\text{vec}(\widehat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_{\mathbf{Y}_s})$ is known from the observed data.
By this transformation to the covariance domain one segments is now represented as the single measurement model with $M(M+1)/2$ ''measurements''. It has been shown that this model allow for identification of $k\leq M(M+1)/2$ active sources \cite{Pal2015}, which is a much weaker sparsity constraint than the original sparsity constraint $k\leq M$. 
The purpose of the Cov-DL algorithm is to leverage this model to find the dictionary $\textbf{A}$ from $\textbf{D}$ and then still allow for $k\leq M(M+1)/2$ active sources to be identified. That is the number of active sources are allowed to exceed the number of observations as intended.

\section{Determination of the Dictionary}
The goal is now to learn first $\textbf{D}$ and then the associated mixing matrix $\textbf{A}$. Two methods are considered relying on the relation of $M$ and $N$.

\section{Considerations and Remarks}
Through this chapter different theory aspects haven been investigated to create a foundation to present one method to be use in the localisation of the sources from EEG measurements -- the recovering of the mixing matrix $\mathbf{A}$ -- yet one method is still to be presented.
Before the method to recover the source matrix $\mathbf{X}$ from the found mixing matrix $\mathbf{A}$ and EEG measurements $\mathbf{Y}$ will be introduced some considerations and remarks regarding the Cov-DL algorithm must be taken -- this will be used in the implementation of the algorithm which will be described in chapter \ref{ch:implementation}.

The length of each segment determined whenever the covariance of the source matrix $\mathbf{X}$ can be described as a diagonal matrix $\boldsymbol{\Lambda}$. That is a segment of $L_s$ samples becomes stationary and therefore the sources within that segment becomes uncorrelated -- the covariance of the source can be described by a diagonal matrix. The number of samples $L_s$ used in one segment affect whenever the segment is stationary or not. This must be taken into account in the preprocessing part of the baseline algorithm when the EEG measurements are divided into segments.

For the Cov-DL algorithm when $\mathbf{D}$ is under-determined a dictionary learning algorithm K-SVD is used to learn the matrix $\mathbf{D}$ and by that an estimate for the mixing matrix $\hat{\mathbf{A}}$. Because of the segmentation the number of samples used in the dictionary learning are reduced remarkably and will affect the learning process. This is another point which must be taken into account in the preprocessing part of the code. To improved the dictionary learning the overlapping of the segments can be look into as each segment will have some similarity and therefore learn towards one direction.

For the Cov-DL algorithm when $\mathbf{D}$ is over-determined the solution tends to be unique when $M < N < (M(M+1))/2$ from testing the solution. That is the cost function tends toward a local minima and therefore an unique solution occur in first run of one trial. For the baseline algorithm it would therefore be necessary to include several random initial points when finding the mixing matrix $\mathbf{A}$ for $\mathbf{D}$ being over-determined.

For a general perspective the sources within the source matrix $\mathbf{X}$ must not be constant over time when using the MMV model \eqref{eq:MMV_model} \todo{Find lige kilde pÃ¥ dette argument}...
