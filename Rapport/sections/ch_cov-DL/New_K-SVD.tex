Consider the EEG measurements matrix $\mathbf{Y} \in \mathbb{R}^M$ consisting of the measurement vectors $\lbrace \mathbf{y}_j \rbrace_j^L$ constructed from the linear system
$$
\mathbf{y}_j = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x}_j.
$$ 
By divided $\mathbf{Y}$ into segment of samples summing up to $L$ samples total a training database is created which one can learn a suitable dictionary $\hat{\mathbf{A}}$, and the sparse representation of the source matrix $\hat{\mathbf{X}} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ with the source vectors $\lbrace \hat{\mathbf{x}}_j \rbrace_j^L$.

For a known sparsity constraint $k$ the dictionary learing can be defined by an optimisation problem similar to the $\ell_1$ optimisation problem defined in \eqref{eq:SMV_p1} instead of multiple measurements \todo{gør opmærksom på at i forhold til det tildligere defineret P1 problem har vi nu støj derfor er de byttet rund}\cite{Elad_book}
\begin{align}\label{eq:SVD1}
\min_{\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{X}} \sum_{j=1}^{L} \Vert \mathbf{y}_j - \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x}_j \Vert_2^2 \quad \text{subject to} \quad \Vert \textbf{x}_j \Vert_1 \leq k, \ 1 \leq j \leq L.
\end{align}  
The learning consists of jointly solving the optimization problem on $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{A}$. The uniqueness of $\mathbf{A}$ depends on the recovery sparsity condition. As clarified earlier in \ref{sec:sol_met} the recovery of a unique solution $\mathbf{X}^\ast$ is only possible if $k < M$ \cite{phd2015}.
    

%The dictionary learning algorithm K-SVD is a generalisation of the well known K-means clustering also referred to as vector quantization. In K-means clustering a set of $K$ vectors is learned referred to as mean vectors. Each signal sample is then represented by its nearest mean vector. That corresponds to the case with sparsity constraint $k = 1$ and the representation reduced to a binary scalar $x = \lbrace 1, 0 \rbrace$. Further instead of computing the mean of $K$ subsets the K-SVD algorithm computes the SVD factorisation of the $K$ different sub-matrices that correspond to the $K$ columns of $\textbf{A}$.
