\chapter{Test on EEG measurements}

\section{Data Description}
\begin{itemize}
\item S1\_Cclean is clean data for the forst subject for closed-yeys condition
\item 27 channels with names and position in EEG.chanlocs structure 
\item Preprocessed: The data is bandpass filtered between 1 and 40 Hz. Then decomposed by ICA and the independent components related to eye activity was removed.
\end{itemize}
\section{Implementing of Baseline Algorithm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Removing Cov-DL and replace it with a random A
\item M is known but not N(k)
\end{itemize}

\section{Test on EEG Data Set}

\subsection{ICA}
\begin{itemize}
\item Description of why we use ICA
	\begin{itemize}
	\item To compare and investigate the performance of the baseline algorithm on real data
	\item 
	\end{itemize}
\item Description of the preprocessing
	\begin{itemize}
	\item As ICA used square data sets we remove sensors from the EEG data set
	\item Either by removing every second, every third og specific sensors
	\item Construct the full mixing matrix and then removing the associated rows/columns.
	\end{itemize}
\item Perform the test
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Baseline Algorithm}
\begin{itemize}
\item
