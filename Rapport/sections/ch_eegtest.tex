\chapter{Test on EEG measurements}\label{ch:eeg_test}
The main algorithm was implemented and tested on synthetic data in chapter \ref{ch:implementation}. In this chapter the main algorithm is tested on EEG measurement, for which it is intended. Two different approaches are consider with respect to evaluating the resulting estimates of the source signals -- ICA comparison and alpha wave analysis, respectively.

At first the provided EEG measurements are described. Followed by test description and analysis of the results for both of the test approaches. 
Finally a summary is provided highlighting the conclusions.  

\section{Data Description}
For this thesis a set of real EEG scalp measurements has been provided, from the the department of .... at AAU. 
The data base consist of 6 set of EEG measurements. For each of three test subjects two data set is provided, one where the test subject sit still with open eyes and one similar but with closed eyes.  
For the measurements an EEG cap with $32$ sensors measuring the scalp EEG signal with sample frequency at $512$Hz\todo{tjek sample frequency ant time} over a period of $XX$ seconds, resulting in $L = XX$ samples. That is 27 channels with names and position available in EEG.chanlocs structure\todo{Matlab eller python her?}.   
Before the data base was provided each raw data set had undergone the following preprocessing.
The data was bandpass filtered between 1 and 40 Hz. Then decomposed by ICA where the independent components related to eye activity or movement was removed. Thus, for every data set 27 sensors remains. 

One data set then consist solely of the measurement matrix $\mathbf{Y} \in \mathbb{R}^{27\times ??}$. The data set is then ready to be divided in segments for which a source matrix $\hat{\textbf{X}}$ is to be estimated by the main algorithm described in chapter \ref{ch:implementation}.

\section{Test Description}
The test procedure is now described through specification of the evaluation criteria and the practical implementation of the test.
Remember that the aim of the developed main algorithm is to estimated the source matrix in the case where the number of sensors is less than the number of active source signals -- $M<k\leq N.$.

\subsection{Performance Evaluation by Comparison to ICA}
From the description of ICA used on EEG measurements, cf. section \ref{sec:ICAsolution} ICA are considered unreliable when using low-density EEG equipment where $M<32$, but for $M\geq 32$ the currently considered the most reliably method for the source estimation. However note again that the true number of sources is not known thus there is always some unreliability to the result. 

From the view that the sources found by ICA where $N=M$ is the best estimate, it is possible to let that estimate serve as a reference to be compared to the estimates achieved when $M<N$. 
In practice that is to perform ICA on a data set $\textbf{Y}\in \mathbb{R}^{M \times L}$ resulting in $\hat{\textbf{X}}_{ICA}\in \mathbb{R}^{N\times L}$ where $M=N$, then a specific number of sensors are removed from the data set $\textbf{Y}$ such that $M<N$ then and $\hat{\textbf{X}}_{Main}\in \mathbb{R}^{N\times L}$ is estimated by the main algorithm. Then the performance of the main algorithm can be measured by comparison to the $\hat{\textbf{X}}_{ICA}$ -- does the main algorithm manage to find the same active sources as ICA, but for $M<N$?

In appendix \ref{app:ica_test}the ICA algorithm is verified on synthetic data without noise. It is found that ICA manage to estimate $\textbf{X}$ almost exact, when $M=N=k$. Furthermore it is seen that for $k < N$ ICA manage to estimate the zero rows as zero. This supports that the estimate by ICA can serve as a reference.     

To compare the two estimates the MSE, cf. section \ref{sec:mse}, is used. 
However an issue arise due to the fact that ICA do not manage to localise each of the found sources. That is the row of $\hat{\textbf{X}}_{ICA}$ do not correspond to the true $\textbf{X}$. Furhtermore the ICA algorithm is invariant toward phase and amplitude. This must necessarily worsen the resulting MSE.  

The issue is cover in appendix \ref{app:ica_test}. Here a function is considered, which manage to pair and fit the rows with the lowest mutual MSE an then arrange the rows of $\hat{\textbf{X}}_{ICA}$ such that $MSE(\textbf{X},\hat{\textbf{X}}_{ICA})$ is minimised. The fitting consist of a possible phase shift and scaling of the the amplitude. 
The right optimal fit was found through af brute-force search, however this is not possible as the possible number of combinations increases as $k$ increases. This suggest the definition of an optimisation problem minimising the resulting MSE with respect to the combination of row indexes, possible phase and corresponding amplitude scaling. Fortunately an successful optimization was not achieved within the time scope of this project, thus the fitting process is not applied to the results achieved from the EEG measurements in this chapter. 
This factor must be taken into account when evaluating the results.    

Consider again the resulting $MSE(\hat{\textbf{X}}_{ICA},\hat{\textbf{X}}_{Main})$. To evaluate further on the question whether the same sources have been found a tolerance for the MSE is introduced. With $MSE(\hat{\textbf{X}}_{ICA},\hat{\textbf{X}}_{Main})$ being an average over the MSE of each row within one segment a low value indicate that main part of the rows makes an estimate similar the estimate from ICA. From this perspective a tolerance for $MSE(\hat{\textbf{X}}_{ICA},\hat{\textbf{X}}_{Main})$ decides whether the same sources are achieved with success. The tolerance is set to 6 due to previous observations with respect to the synthetic data, especially figure \ref{fig:AR2} indicate that an MSE below 6 is achievable for a system where $M<<N$ with use of $\textbf{A}_real$. It could be argued that the tolerance should be increased as the estimate of $\textbf{A}$ is not expected to be nearly as good, however this will could give a distorted image of the results.          

\subsection{Test Setup}
The test set up is visualised in figure \ref{fig:flow2} by a flow diagram, showing the essential steps of the test.

In the flow diagram the two estimation processes are seen to run parallel but taking the same input. 
Prior to the application of ICA the input is divided into segments. That is the same segmentation as inside the main algorithm, cf. section \ref{sec:implementation_flow}.
The size of the segments are defined due to the expected stationarity of the sources. As described in the motivation chapter \ref{ch:motivation} sources are stationary if you look at sufficiently small intervals. 
Segments at $t = 1$ second is chosen from the belief that the brain activity can be assumed stationary with in short time interval furthermore one must take in mind that shorter time interval lead to more segments and therefore a higher computational complexity.   
After the segmentation the ICA is applied to every segment, returning $\hat{\textbf{X}}_{ICA s} \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times L_s}$.
From appendix \ref{app:ica_test} it is seen that ICA manage to estimate the non-active sources by zero rows, when no noise is present. When ICA is applied to the EEG measurements noise is expected. Thus the non active sources defined by the average amplitude being within a tolerance interval around zero, defined by tol = $[10E-03, -10E-03]$. 
When the non-active sources are identified they are removed and      
the resulting estimate is reduced to $\hat{\textbf{X}}_{ICA s} \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times L_s}$. The found number of active sources $k$ is then given as input to the main algorithm where $k = N$. 
In parallel to the ICA process the input data is reduced as specified in the previous subsection. Then the main algorithm is applied to the reduced data set. Within the main algorithm the data is like wise divided in segments and an estimate $\hat{\textbf{X}}_{Main s} \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times L_s}$ is returned. Note that $\textbf{A}_{fix}$ is given as a manual input, replacing the COV-DL algorithm as concluded in chapter \ref{ch:implementation}.
At the end the resulting two estimates have the same dimensions which allows for $\hat{\textbf{X}}_{Main s}$ to be evaluated with respect to $\hat{\textbf{X}}_{ICA s}$ by the MSE.

The described test is performed on the following three cases,
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Case 0}: $M = N$ , to see the best possible result achieved by the main algorithm. 
\item \textbf{Case 1}: $M < N$ every third sensor is removed. 
\item \textbf{Case 2}: $M << N$ every second sensor is removed.
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}
For each case the test is performed on three data set -- \texttt{S1\_Cclean}, \texttt{S2\_Cclean} and \texttt{S3\_Cclean}. Measurements for three test subjects sitting with closed eyes in $??$ seconds.
The results is plotted for one data set for visual understanding, lastly the results of all three data sets are compared in a table.

\subsection{Summary of Results}
The main algorithm have been tested on 6 data sets of EEG measurement, for a varying relation between the number of sensors and sensors -- respectively case 0, 1 and 2.
When the number of sensors is reduced with respect to the number of sources to be found, a significant decrease in performance was found -- comparing case 0 and 1. 
However a corresponding decrease of performance was not found when further sensors was removed -- comparing case 1 and 2. 

From the conclusions made in chapter \ref{ch:implemantation} it was not expected that the main algorithm would provide successful results, without estimating $\textbf{A}$ form the data. The results of case 0 do however indicate a solid estimate provided by the main algorithm, with an average percentage of successfully estimated segments at $83\%$. 

Furthermore it is worth to note that the resulting MSE values has potential for improvement when considering optimization of the source localisation of the ICA estimate, cf. appendix \ref{app:ica_test}.
