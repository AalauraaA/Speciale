\chapter{Implementation and Verification}\label{ch:implementation}
This chapter describes the implementation process of the main algorithm. 
The main algorithm is the two algorithms Cov-DL and M-SBL from respectively chapter \ref{ch:Cov-DL} and \ref{ch:M-SBL} combined into one algorithm.

The implementation of each algorithm is initially tested on a simple simulated data set to verify the implementation. 
Next, both algorithms are tested on simulated data which aim to resemble real EEG measurements. 
By simulating the data set the true model parameters are known which allows for measuring the precision of the algorithms. 
In addition different model variables are investigated in order to improve the model.
Finally, the main algorithm is tested on the simulated data sets, and a conclusion is made based on the results.
