\chapter{Implementation and Verification}\label{ch:implementation}
In this chapter the implementation process of the main algorithm is described. 
The main algorithm is the two methods Cov-DL and M-SBL from respectively chapter \ref{ch:Cov-DL} and \ref{ch:M-SBL} combined into one algorithm.

The implementation of each method is initially tested on a simple deterministic simulated data to verify the implementation. 
Next, tests are performed on stochastic simulated data which aim to resemble real EEG measurements. 
By simulating a data set the true model parameters are known which allows for measuring the precision of the implemented methods. 
In addition different model variables are investigated in order to improve the model.
Finally, the main algorithm is tested on the stochastic data sets, and conclusions are drawn based on the results.
