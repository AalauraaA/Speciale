\chapter{Baseline Algorithm}\label{ch:implementation}
Through the first 6 chapters a motivation behind investigation the identification of sources from EEG measurement with more sources than sensors as been exploit. From the linear multiple measurement vector (MMV) model
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{AX},
\end{align*}
the theory and methods behind recovering the mixing matrix $\mathbf{A}$ and the source matrix $\mathbf{X}$ have being investigated leading to two algorithms -- covariance-domain dictionary learning (Cov-DL) algorithm and multiple sparse Bayesian learning (M-SBL) algorithm -- which recover the mixing matrix and source matrix from the EEG measurements with more sources than sensors.

Through this chapter the two algorithm will be implemented into one algorithm -- the baseline algorithm -- with the purpose to be tested to investigate how good the recovering process is. 
For the testing different data sets will be used. Some data sets will be synthetic to investigate whenever a solution occur and then the baseline algorithm will be tested on realistic data sets.

First and all, a discussing whenever to use $k$ or $N$ as a parameter for the number of active sources within the brain, as this number is unknown the realistic case, will be starting this chapter.
