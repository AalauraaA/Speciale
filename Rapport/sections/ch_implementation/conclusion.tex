\section{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
\item The estimation of $\textbf{A}$ is not really working
		\begin{itemize}
		\item essentially we see the performance of source separation when a random Gaussian matrix is used as Mixing matrix. Which seem to be okay for our simulated data, where we know it is a Gaussian matrix matrix which is used. However we do not know that about the real EEG data   
\end{itemize}		 
\item The estimation of $\textbf{X}$ with use of the true $\textbf{A}$ is okay. So to used that on our EEG, we need some alternative mixing matrix as it is not known for the EEG data. 
\end{itemize}
