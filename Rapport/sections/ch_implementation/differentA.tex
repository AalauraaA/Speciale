\section{Mixing Matrix A}
As concluded the Cov-DL algorithm do not recover a sufficient mixing matrix $\mathbf{A}$ and therefore other actions must be taken. 

Instead a fixed mixing matrix $\mathbf{A}_{\text{fixed}}$ could be a better choice. However, this fixed mixing matrix must have some of the same characteristic as the true mixing matrix. 
From observations of the true mixing matrix from the autoregressive data set some choice could be:
\begin{itemize}
\item A matrix drawn from uniform distribution in the half open interval $[-1.0, 1.0)$.
\item A matrix drawn from random distribution with mean $0$ and variance $2$.
\item A matrix drawn from a Gaussian distribution with mean $0$ and variance $1$.
\item A matrix computed from ICA of EEG measurements provided from EEGLab\footnote{EEGLab is....}.
\end{itemize}
