\section{Parameter Choice}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Describe why we want to set $N = k$, logical discussion. No results yet to back up the assuming.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The amount of $N$ is unknown as it change for every brain
	\item Therefore, we do not know the amount of activation inside the brain, but it those there are of interest in this thesis.
	\end{itemize}
\item Talk about the parameter choice for $M$ and $N$ -- a low-density system have what? $M =  8$ and $N = 16$ or $N = 32$.
\end{enumerate}
