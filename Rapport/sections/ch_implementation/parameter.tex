\section{Model Variables}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Describe why we want to set $N = k$, logical discussion. No results yet to back up the assuming.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The amount of $N$ is unknown as it change for every brain
	\item Therefore, we do not know the amount of activation inside the brain, but it those there are of interest in this thesis.
	\item Due to the method for determine the mixing matrix $\textbf{A}$ the ration between $N$ and $k$ do not affect the result, hence there are no argument against letting $N=k$ which will lower the computational complexity.\todo[inline]{do the same argument regarding $N=k$ hold for the determination of $\textbf{X}$? after the awareness that we do not need to provide $k$ to M-SBL as it has been done so far. If we do not provide $k$ it will seek the sparest solution right?}    
	\end{itemize}
\item Talk about the parameter choice for $M$ and $N$ -- a low-density system have what? $M =  8$ and $N = 16$ or $N = 32$.
