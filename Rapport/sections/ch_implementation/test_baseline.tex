\section{Test of the Main Algorithm}\label{sec:test_base}
In this section the performance of the main algorithm is tested. That is the algorithm visualised in the flow diagram, figure \ref{fig:flow}, where the COV-DL algorithm and the M-SBL algorithm i combined. However, as dissucsed due to the negative conclusion on the verification of COV-DL an alternative has to be is considered.

\subsection{Performance Test of Main Algorithm}\label{sec:Main_test}
In order to evaluate the performance of the main algorithm tests are conducted on several simulated stochastic data sets with different specification. 
The aim is to see how the relationship between $N$ and $M$ affect the performance, in other words how robust the algorithm is towards low density measurements. 
The main algorithm is tested on simulated stochastic data sets specified by $M=8$, $L=1000$, $k=N$ with $N$ in the range $N = [M+1,\dots,36]$, as such $k<\widetilde{M}$ is withhold insuring a solution.
For each value of $N$ ten different data sets are simulated and solved, and the average $\text{MSE}(\mathbf{X}, \hat{\mathbf{X}})$ are used as the result. 
The average $\text{MSE}(\mathbf{X}, \hat{\mathbf{X}})$ are plotted in figure \ref{fig:varyN1}.

	\label{fig:varyN1}
\end{figure}
\noindent
From figure \ref{fig:varyN1} it is seen that the $\text{MSE}(\mathbf{X}, \hat{\mathbf{X}})$ lies in the interval $[4,14]$, however no clear trend appears in the plot. 
This suggest that it is not an representative average which have been plotted, thus the test is repeated with more repetitions for value of $N$. The new result of the $\text{MSE}(\mathbf{X}, \hat{\mathbf{X}})$ is seen in figure \ref{fig:varyN2}.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/ch_6/varyN2.png}
	\caption{Visualization of $\text{MSE}(\mathbf{X}, \hat{\mathbf{X}})$ of the main algorithm with simulated stochastic data sets specified by $M = 8$, $L=1000$ and $k = N$ for $N = M+1, \hdots , 36$. Average over 500 repetitions for each $N$.}
	\label{fig:varyN2}
\end{figure}  
\noindent
Figure \ref{fig:varyN2} confirms the result of the first test. Thus it must be that average behaviour which is seen. 
This suggest that the performance of the main algorithm is not affected by the relation between $M$ and $N$.
However, this assumption is counter intuitive and it is a contradiction to the results seen in figure \ref{fig:AR1} and \ref{fig:AR2}, where the true $\mathbf{A}$ was utilised. 
Thus the choice of the alternative estimate $\hat{\mathbf{A}}_{\text{norm}}$ might have influenced the results negatively.  
Furthermore it is worth to notice the relative large interval of the $\text{MSE}(\mathbf{X}, \hat{\mathbf{X}})$ suggesting a vary high variance within the resulting $\text{MSE}(\mathbf{X}, \hat{\mathbf{X}})$, which add a certain unreliability to the results \todo{Ã†ndre tekst i figuren -- norm -L}.
