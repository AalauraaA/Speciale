\section{Test of the Baseline Algorithm}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Test the algorithm for the toy example
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Test for $M = 8$ and varying $N = 8, 16, 32$. Plot the errors in the same plot.
	\item Test for $M = 16$ and varying $N = 16, 32$. Plot the errors in the same plot.
	\item Compare the errors with the errors achieved with the real A
	\end{itemize}	 
\item Test the algorithm for the AR data
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Test for $M = 8$ and varying $N = 8, 16, 32$. Plot the errors in the same plot.
	\item Test for $M = 16$ and varying $N = 16, 32$. Plot the errors in the same plot.
	\item Compare the errors with the errors achieved with the real A
	\end{itemize}	
\end{enumerate}
