\subsection{Test}
In order to evaluate the performance of the resulting baseline algorithm tests are conducted on several simulated stochastic data sets with different specification. The aim is to see how the relationship between $N$ and $M$ affect the performance, in other word how robust the algorithm is towards low density measurements. 
The baseline algorithm is on an AR data specified by $M=8$, $L=1000$, $k=N$ and N in the range $N = [M+1, 36]$, as such $k<\frac{M(M+1)}{2}$ are withhold insuring a solution.
For each value of $N$ 5 different data sets are simulated and solved and the average MSE are used as the result. The result are plotted in figure \ref{fig:varyN1}, the MSE is plotted for both $\textbf{X}$ and $\textbf{A}$. 
Due to the performance of COV-DL not being as good as expected, a similar test is made where the true $\textbf{A}$ is given as input to M-SBL. These results are visualised in figure \ref{fig:varyN2}.
