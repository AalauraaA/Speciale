\chapter{Problem Analysis}
This chapter examines existing literature concerning source localisation from EEG measurements. At first a motivation for the problem is given, considering especially the application within the hearing aid industry. Further, the state of the art methods are presented follow by a description of the desired contribution. 

\section{Motivation}
EEG recordings or measurements are used within medicine as an imaging technique measuring electric signals on the scalp, caused by brain activity. \\
\\
The brain consist of a enormous amounts of cells, called neurons. These neurons are mutually connected in neural nets and when a neuron is activated, for instance by some physical stimuli, local current flows are produced\cite{â€¢}. As such the neurons are some how communicating(?). \\
