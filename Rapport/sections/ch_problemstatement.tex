\chapter{Problem Statement}\label{ch:problemstatement}
Through chapter \ref{ch:motivation} the potential of EEG measurements and especially low-density EEG measurements have been established. Furthermore, this potential is found to be increased through recovery of the original brain sources given the measurements. This involves solving the EEG inverse problem, in the case of the problem being under-determined.
Two state of the art methods are seen to solve the issue with success, but the use of a parameter unknown in practise limits the potential of the methods for practical use.

This motivates the following problem statement.         
\\ \\
\textit{Based on state of the art methods, how can the original sources of brain activity be recovered from the EEG inverse problem, in the under-determined case, and how can this be modified to increase the potential of practical use?}
\\ \\
From the problem statement the following sub-questions is established for clarification.
\begin{itemize}
\item How can Cov-DL be used to estimate the mixing matrix $\mathbf{A}$ from the overcomplete EEG inverse problem?
\item How can M-SBL be used to estimate the source matrix $\mathbf{X}$ from the overcomplete EEG inverse problem?
\item How can the above methods be implemented as one application performing source recovery from EEG measurements in real-time? 
\item How can the number of active sources be estimated, based only on the EEG measurement? 
\end{itemize}
