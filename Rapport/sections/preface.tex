This master thesis has been written by Trine Nyholm Kragh and Laura Nyrup Mogensen, 4th semester students of the Master programme in Mathematical Engineering at Aalborg University. 
The students want to thank their supervisors Jan Ã˜stergaard from Department
of Electronical Systems and Rasmus Waagepetersen from Department of Mathematical Sciences for their guidance and help to conduct this study. Furthermore a thank you goes to PhD student Payam Shahsavari Baboukani for sharing EEG measurement and corresponding guidance.  

The theme of this master thesis is mathematical modelling of EEG measurements for source recovery based on existing method, aiming to support existing the results.
As for prerequisites, the reader is expected to be familiar with linear algebra, optimisation theory and probability theory.
Citations are provided in the form [citation number], or [citation number, page number] especially for books, with every source having a unique citation number to be found the bibliography where each source is specified by the necessary information. 
In appendix \ref{app:Cov-DL}, \ref{app:B} and \ref{app:ICA} supplementary theory for the presented methods can be found. In appendix \ref{App:code} a list and outline of the scripts developed during this thesis can be found. The scripts are written in Python 3.6 and can be downloaded through GitHub link XX.
